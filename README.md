# Code navigation tool extract from doom-emacs

Original code is [here](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/master/modules/tools/lookup).

I modify some codes to make this tool can be used on vanilla emacs. I am satisfied with this package, but it may not be suitable for everyone.

This package is extract from doom-emacs, so the usage is same, but has fewer commands to bind keys:

- `+lookup/definition`
- `+lookup/references`
- `+lookup/file`

For the comprehensive configuration, look for the document of doom-emacs [lookup module](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/master/modules/tools/lookup).

Thanks for doom-emacs!
